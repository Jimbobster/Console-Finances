  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic âœ¨! </h1>
  <script src="index.js"></script>

  <h2>Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:</h2>

<li>The total number of months included in the dataset.

  <li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    <li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))

<li>The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

<li>The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

<p>When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:</p>

<ol>Financial Analysis 
----------------
<li>Months: 86
  <li>Total: $38382578
    <li>Average Change: -2315.12
      <li>Greatest Increase in <li>Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
        <li>Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
<p></p>Your final code should print the analysis to the console.</p>
</li>

Hints:

You will need to do some research on your own for this project!

Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console you will need to use concatenation.

How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
