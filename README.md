# Console-Finances

## Description
I was tasked to write Javascript code to create a financial analysis tool. 

This tool analyzes financial data records to calculate each of the following, using strings and variables combined using concatenation:

  
<li>The total number of months included in the dataset

<li>The net total amount of Profit and Losses over the entire period

<li>The average of the changes in Profit and Losses over the entire period

<li>The total change in Profit and Losses were from month to month and then find the average

<li>The greatest increase in Profit and Losses (date and amount) over the entire period

<li>The greatest decrease in Profit and Losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## Installation
When you open the code in the browser, then the resulting analysis should display in the console section by following the steps below :

<ol>
<li>Open the browser by clicking on this link : https://jimbobster.github.io/Console-Finances/

<li>Right Click on the page and choose inspect

<li>Open the console and you will see the resulting analysis
</ol>
